Decription

- For my project i decided to put a twist on the game of blackjack
- The player will go to the game and begin with a bankroll of 2000$
- They can then choose however much they want to wager with the betting chip
	denominations.
- Then the cards are played the user will be able to not only see their cards but also 
	the dealers.
- The user has the option to stand or hit on their hand as they compare their hand to the
	users.
- I have 3 classes which i talk about within the video i have included in this zip.
- To win the user must have a higher total card value then the dealer, if the user has 
	a total card value of over 21 they will bust.
